# Evolve Plan Card

> Cycle: EV-039 | Session: S047-sql-ingest-live-e2e | Updated: 2026-08-06

## Goal

Live-verify F16 SQL BYOC upload against local Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, and SQLite via
Playwright, with mandatory teardown across integration, e2e, and local harnesses.

## Features

- F16 — Dissemination drawer + multi-DB BYOC URI upload (deepen) — [Corpus: product §F16]

## In / out of scope

- In: Compose profile for PG/MySQL/SQL Server; SQLite file path; live Playwright preflight+send;
  teardown audit/fix for integration + e2e + local; test-plan / journey / tech-spec deltas
- Out: New vendors; live WIS2/EDIS/F19; prod SQL containers; new Fn; UI preview this cycle

## Preset + routing

- Preset: **Standard**
- Stages (ordered): `00 → 16 → 01 → 02 → 04 → 05 → 07 → 08 → 09 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13`
- Skip: `03`, `06` (unless later need)

## Next child stage

**13-deploy-smoke** — push/PR → tip CI green → merge (explicit) → H1–H5 on live.

## Risks / open decisions

- SQL Server waived on this Mac (QEMU) — accepted `D-S047-11`
- `js-yaml` pin ⇒ FE rebuild on merge; H4–H5 required at 13 (`D-S047-12`)
- No prod SQL containers this cycle
